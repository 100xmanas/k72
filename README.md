# Overview

- This project is a clone of the official K72 Creative Agency website, built entirely using **React and GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform).**
- The goal of this clone is to replicate the original site's stunning motion design, scroll-based interactions, and seamless user experience, while demonstrating my ability to implement modern web animations and component-based architecture.

# Tech Stack
- **React.js**– For component-driven structure and reactivity
- **GSAP** – For smooth, performance-optimized animations
- **ScrollTrigger (GSAP Plugin)** – To create scroll-based transitions and section reveals
- **Tailwind CSS** – For clean, responsive, and utility-first styling
- **Vite** – For fast development and optimized builds

# What I Learned
- Deepen my understanding of GSAP timelines and ScrollTrigger integration in React
- Practice replicating high-end UI/UX design patterns
- Improve animation sequencing and performance optimization
- Build a clean, scalable React structure for animation-heavy projects

# Conclusion
_Cloning **K72.ca** was a creative and technical challenge that pushed me to explore advanced front-end animation techniques and modern design implementation._
